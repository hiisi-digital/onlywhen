## Runtime Compatibility

> Last tested: 2025-12-12

These tests verify that the package works correctly in each runtime environment.
Runtime detection (`runtime.node`, `runtime.deno`, etc.) is tested, along with
API functionality. Platform detection is cross-platform by design.

| Runtime | Version | Status |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| Deno    | v1.x    | ✅     |
| Deno    | v2.x    | ✅     |
| Node.js | 18      | ✅     |
| Node.js | 20      | ✅     |
| Node.js | 22      | ✅     |
| Bun     | canary  | ✅     |
| Bun     | latest  | ✅     |
