/**
 * The README's TypeScript examples type-check.
 *
 * They are generated from template literals in `scripts/generate_readme.ts`,
 * which means the compiler never sees them: a string containing broken code is
 * still a valid string. Two examples shipped broken for exactly that reason.
 * The first usage example in the readme passed a `FeatureManifest | null`
 * straight into a function wanting a `FeatureManifest`, so anyone pasting it
 * got two type errors on their first contact with this package.
 *
 * This test extracts every fenced `typescript` block and checks it as the
 * reader would, with this repo's own import map.
 *
 * A block is allowed to reference names it never defines: an illustrative
 * snippet does that on purpose, and demanding otherwise would push the readme
 * toward complete programs nobody wants to read. So `TS2304` and `TS2552`,
 * which are exactly "you used a name that is not declared", do not fail this
 * test. Everything else does, because everything else is the readme being
 * wrong about the package.
 *
